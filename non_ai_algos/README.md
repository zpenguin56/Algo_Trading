# Non-AI Trading Algorithms

This directory contains sophisticated trading algorithms that don't rely on artificial intelligence or machine learning. These algorithms use traditional quantitative finance techniques, technical analysis, and statistical methods to identify trading opportunities.

## Algorithms

- **Adaptive Market Regime Strategy**: A multi-strategy approach that adapts to different market regimes
- **Multi-Factor Rotation Model**: Combines momentum, value, quality and volatility factors
- **Statistical Arbitrage Pairs Trading**: Identifies and trades correlated securities
- **Dynamic Risk Parity Portfolio**: Allocates risk equally across assets

Each algorithm is designed to be used on QuantConnect's platform.
