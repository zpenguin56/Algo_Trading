# Advanced Non-AI Trading Algorithms

This directory contains sophisticated quantitative trading algorithms that don't rely on artificial intelligence. These algorithms use advanced statistical methods, regime detection, and risk management techniques to create robust trading strategies deployable on QuantConnect.

## Strategies

### 1. Adaptive Multi-Factor Strategy (`adaptive_multi_factor_strategy.py`)

An advanced equity selection strategy that adapts to different market regimes and uses multiple factors to select securities.

**Key Features:**
- **Market Regime Detection**: Automatically identifies trending, volatile, and normal market conditions
- **Multi-Factor Selection**: Combines value, momentum, quality, and volatility factors
- **Adaptive Weights**: Adjusts factor weights based on market regime
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Implements position sizing and sector exposure limits
- **Portfolio Construction**: Uses correlation-based diversification

This strategy is ideal for long-term equity investing with reduced drawdowns through its adaptive nature.

### 2. Statistical Arbitrage Pairs Trading (`statistical_arbitrage_pairs_trading.py`)

A sophisticated mean-reversion strategy that finds statistically related pairs of securities and trades their spread.

**Key Features:**
- **Cointegration Analysis**: Identifies pairs with statistically significant mean-reversion properties
- **Half-Life Calculation**: Measures the speed of mean reversion for optimal trade timing
- **Hurst Exponent**: Confirms true mean-reverting behavior of pairs
- **Kelly Criterion Sizing**: Optimizes position sizes based on win probability and risk/reward
- **Dynamic Stop-Loss**: Implements Z-score based stop-loss and take-profit levels

This market-neutral strategy performs well in choppy markets and provides diversification benefits to directional strategies.

### 3. Volatility Regime Risk Parity (`volatility_regime_risk_parity.py`)

A sophisticated asset allocation strategy that implements risk parity principles across different asset classes, with dynamic adjustments based on volatility regimes.

**Key Features:**
- **Risk Parity Portfolio Construction**: Allocates risk equally across asset classes rather than capital
- **Volatility Regime Detection**: Identifies high, normal, and low volatility environments
- **Tactical Tilts**: Applies momentum and trend overlays to the base allocation
- **Volatility Targeting**: Maintains consistent risk exposure regardless of market conditions
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Adjusts portfolio when weights deviate significantly from targets

This strategy is designed for long-term investors seeking stable returns with managed drawdowns across different market environments.

## Implementation Details

### Requirements

These algorithms require the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- statsmodels
- sklearn (for some strategies)

All strategies are designed to work with QuantConnect's LEAN engine and can be deployed directly on the platform.

### Usage on QuantConnect

1. Log in to your QuantConnect account
2. Create a new algorithm
3. Copy the code from the desired strategy file
4. Paste into the QuantConnect algorithm editor
5. Backtest and deploy

### Risk Management

All strategies incorporate sophisticated risk management techniques:

- **Position Sizing**: Dynamic position sizing based on volatility and other risk factors
- **Stop-Loss Mechanisms**: Tailored stop-loss mechanisms appropriate for each strategy
- **Exposure Limits**: Constraints on sector, asset class, and individual security exposures
- **Drawdown Control**: Mechanisms to reduce exposure during extended drawdowns
- **Volatility Targeting**: Consistent risk exposure through varying market conditions

## Performance Expectations

While past performance is not indicative of future results, these strategies are designed to:

- Generate alpha across different market regimes
- Provide better risk-adjusted returns than passive indices
- Minimize drawdowns during market stress
- Adapt to changing market conditions

## Customization

Each strategy can be customized by modifying parameters such as:

- Lookback periods for indicators and signals
- Volatility targets and risk limits
- Rebalancing frequencies and thresholds
- Factor weights and regime definitions

## Disclaimer

These trading algorithms are provided for educational and research purposes only. Trading involves significant risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. Always thoroughly test any strategy before committing real capital.
